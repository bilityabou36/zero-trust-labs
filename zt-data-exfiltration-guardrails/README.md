# Zero Trust Data Exfiltration Guardrails — VPC Endpoint Enforcement

## Overview
This project implements a Zero Trust data egress boundary by restricting S3 access to an approved private network path (S3 VPC Endpoint) and validating enforcement under misuse conditions.

## Status
- Day 1: Baseline VPC/EC2 verification (in progress)
- Day 2: S3 VPC Endpoint creation + validation (pending)
- Day 3: Bucket policy enforcement (SourceVpce) (pending)
- Day 4: Misuse testing + final packaging (pending)

## Evidence
