# Zero Trust Labs

This repository contains hands-on Zero Trust architecture labs demonstrating how traditional perimeter- and network-based trust models are replaced with identity-driven, auditable access controls.

The labs align with:
- NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust Architecture)
- Enterprise PAM and privileged access models
- Cloud-native Zero Trust implementations

## Current Labs

### Network Pillar
- **Private EC2 Access Without SSH (AWS SSM)**  
  Identity-based privileged access to EC2 with no inbound ports, no VPN, and full session auditing.

## Design Philosophy
- Identity over network location
- Explicit verification
- Least privilege access
- Continuous monitoring and auditability

Each lab includes:
- Architecture diagram
- Evidence artifacts
- Clear mapping to Zero Trust principles
